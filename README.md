# 💬 Text-to-Speech App using Python 🗣️

![App Preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0533d9e8-cb49-4e30-acea-26cb6594b8bf)

This is a custom-built **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** desktop application made as part of my 🚀 **Day 3 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge**  .  
It uses `Tkinter` for the GUI and `gTTS` (Google Text-to-Speech) to convert user-input text into voice.

## ✨ Features

✅ Simple and clean GUI (designed from scratch)  
✅ Built using Python's `Tkinter` and `gTTS`  
✅ Converts text into speech in one click  
✅ Auto-cleans temporary audio files  
✅ Colorful, beginner-friendly UI with styled buttons and layout

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Tkinter** – for GUI components
- **gTTS** – for speech synthesis (Google Text-to-Speech)
- **macOS** – tested with `afplay` for audio playback
